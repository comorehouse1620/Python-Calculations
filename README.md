# Lab 1 â€“ Calculations with Python
## Lab Description
This lab's purpose was to calculate agricultural land and rain runoff in Kenya. 
## Summary of script
This script aims to achieve the output of run-off in gallons from a 1 inch rainstorm on a 1000 feet-sqaure plot of land. This script achieves this by taking the initial inputs (plot length in feet, plot width in feet, and rainfall amount in inches) and creating variables, expressions, and statements. 
## Major Issues
The only debugging that was necessary was a few times I mispelled a variable when creating an expression, and then when I used the print statement I got an error code. This was fixable by reading through my code carefully. 
In terms of outside resources, I used stack overflow to find an expression that would allow me to display the final output of rainfall in gallons in 2 decimal places, as well as Google to find out the conversion of 1 liquid gallon to cubic inches.
